    <h3 id="header22">Adopting Vs Buying </h3>
    <p id="ph22">Adopting is supposrting a cause, by adopting <br> you are not only saving
    one animal, but two. <br> by getting that pet and making a space for the <br>
  shelters to save another.<br>By buying a pet, you are supporting breeders who are <br>
  brutal to animals, they breed animals in poor tight places,<br> with minimum
  to no medical care at all. </p>

<div class="leftpart">
  <h3 id="header23">How to find your perfect buddy</h3>
  <p id="ph23">Owning a pet is a responsibility, a comitment that not everyone
  can take, and that is why you need to consider the following things:</p>
  <dl id="list1">
    <dt><b>-Living space</b></dt>
    <dd id="dd1">Usually the first thing to consider when looking to adopt a pet is how
    much space you can provide for it, as logically small dog breeds such as (chihuahuas,pugs)
    won't need as much space as a bigger dog breed such as(German Sheprads, Poodles).<br> furthermore
    do keep in mind that most smaller dog breeds do require more space than cats as they tend to be
    more energetic.</dd>

    <dt><b>-Time comitment</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Each indivisual pet has its own time and attention needs that have to be met
      on daily bases. In general cats tend to be more independent than dogs or parrots
      therefore they require the least amount of interaction time. On the other hand,
      dogs tend to be very active and require daily walks and play time so please
      check your weekly schedule and see how much time you would like to dedicate
      to your new friend!
    </dd>

    <dt><b>-Expenses</b></dt>
    <dd>Regardless of your choice of pet all pets require basic needs such as
      food, toys and veternary visits, you should consider these bills before
      adopting your pet!
