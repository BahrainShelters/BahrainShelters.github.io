<div class="foster">
  <h2 id="inv8">Foster</h2>
  <p id="pnv8">If you are not sure if you could handle a pet and you don't know the responsibilities,
  you might consider fostering. But you first need to know what fostering is.
Fostering means to get a pet from a rescue group or a shelter, to take care of that pet
and keep it with you for a while until we find it a forever home.
what is the purpose of fostering? well, fostering helps us make more space for New rescued pets
to come, and it will for sure help the pets get used to what their lives would look like in
the future.
who knows? you might adopt the pet that you are fostering</p>
